Hi Amy!

# Setting up Ruby on the command line

`touch .ruby-version` # create a file, but then manually set 2.7 in the first line
`echo ruby-3-training > .ruby-gemset` # create the file, and set the first line from the terminal

`cd ..` then `cd ruby-intro` will set the ruby version

# Our first test and object

Run minitest:
`ruby test_dog.rb`
